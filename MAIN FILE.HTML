Sri Krishna Swamy Temple or the Ambalapuzha Temple is one of the most rewarding places to visit in 
Alleppey. The temple is the oldest Krishna temples in Kerala and among the oldest in India too. The 
temple has a lovely, soothing ambiance which will calm you down and make you simply want to sit in the 
temple for hours on the end. The inner sanctum is decorated with paintings of Sri Krishna and the other 
incarnations of Lord Vishnu. A large mandapam outside is a great place to sit and absorb the atmosphere 
of the temple. Because of its importance in the Vaishnava tradition, the temple is also popularly 
considered to be the “Dwarka of the South”, which is a great distinction to confer on a place.
